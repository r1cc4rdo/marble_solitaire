### N채ive algorithm

The n채ive algorithm that brute-forces through all possible combination through
recursion has a large time complexity since the number of board states grows
exponentially after each move.

One way to reduce the time complexity is realizing that sequence of different
moves can lead to the same configuration, and performing the evaluation of that
branch only once. This can be done with memoization of the recursive evaluation
call. The [marble_solitaire.py](marble_solitaire.py) script shows an example of
such an implementation.

### Full state space search

Even with memoization, the n채ive algorithm ends up considering too many branches,
and visiting board configurations equivalent up to rotations and flip to others already
explored.

Moreover, it only explores a single path from root to leaves at a time: since the number
of early-stops greatly outnumbers the good solutions for a given number of final pegs/marbles,
the majority of time is spent exploring dead-ends.

Therefore, the non-n채ive algorithm generates all and only the valid configurations after
a number of moves, while detecting mirrored and rotated configurations.
